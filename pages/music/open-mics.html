		<h1>Open Mics Around Christchurch</h1>
		<p>I'm a new musician (I started in 2023). I love to sing and play guitar, especially at open mics.</p>
		<p>There's several good open mics that I go to around Christchurch.</p>
		<h2>Boo's</h2>
		<p>This is my favourite one: it's on every Wednesday and is hosted by my friend, and master musician (and musicologist!), Anand Yoganathan.</p>
		<p>They have an electro-acoustic guitar, an amp, and monitor speakers, two microphones, and a piano (we normally put a mic onto the piano so people can hear it) which you can use. Of course you can bring your own instruments as well.</p>
		<p>Relaxed atmosphere in a bar with no stage set up or anything.</p>

		<h2>Darkroom</h2>
		<p>This one is once a month, every first Wednesday of the month.</p>
		<p>Darkroom is an awesome venue that does a lot of cool alternative music, and the sound technicians for the open mic are great too (Nick, co-owner of Darkroom and also the drummer in the legendary local band The Wendys; Milz, my friend who plays jazz bass, who is an "intern" sound tech at these open mics).</p>
		<p>They have a guitar, a guitar amp and a bass amp, a drum kit, and two microphones.</p>

		<h2>A Rolling Stone</h2>
		<p>I'm new to this one, but it's got the most advanced set up out of all the open mics I've been to. There's a decently sized stage with amps, a drum kit, two microphones, and really good monitor speakers. The sound guy works from a booth across from the stage and really knows his stuff.</p>
		<p>It's on every Thursday but is less consistent with their schedule than Boo's or Darkroom. Sometimes they do originals-only nights!</p>
